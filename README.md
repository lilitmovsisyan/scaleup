# scaleup

scaleup is a django webapp that generates random scales to help practise violin. 
This is adapted from the violin_scale_generator python app.

TO DO:

1. add more variety of scale sets/users
2. use more of the code from violin_scale_generator to add more functionality 
(e.g. prevent repeated scale generation)
